#TODOLIST-Project
This To-Do Listproject is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently by adding, deleting, and
marking tasks as completed. The interface is clean and user-friendly, thanks to custom styling with CSS, while JavaScript handles the dynamic functionality, 
such as storing tasks in the browser's local storage, enabling persistence across page reloads. 
This project is a great introduction to DOM manipulation and basic web development concepts.
